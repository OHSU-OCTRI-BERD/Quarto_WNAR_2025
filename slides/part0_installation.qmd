Before we begin, please ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **R:** A recent version of R is required. You can download it from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2.  **RStudio:** Download the latest version from the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Quarto is built right into RStudio, making it the easiest way to get started.

You will also need to install a few R packages. Open RStudio and run the following code in the console:

```r
install.packages(c("palmerpenguins", "tidyverse", "gt", "remotes"))
remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/countdown")
```

- **palmerpenguins**: For example datasets.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages for data science.
- **gt**: For creating beautiful tables.
- **countdown**: To add timers to your slides.

If you do not already have **rmarkdown** installed, please install that as well.
