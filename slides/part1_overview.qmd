## Part 0: Installation

Before we begin, please ensure you have the following installed:

1.  **R:** A recent version of R is required. You can download it from the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/).
2.  **RStudio:** Download the latest version from the [RStudio website](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Quarto is built right into RStudio, making it the easiest way to get started.

You will also need to install a few R packages. Open RStudio and run the following code in the console:

```r
install.packages(c("palmerpenguins", "tidyverse", "gt", "remotes"))
remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/countdown")
```

- **palmerpenguins**: For example datasets.
- **tidyverse**: A collection of R packages for data science.
- **gt**: For creating beautiful tables.
- **countdown**: To add timers to your slides.

If you do not already have **rmarkdown** installed, please install that as well.


# Quarto Overview
  
## What is Quarto?
  
  Quarto is a next-generation version of R Markdown from Posit. It is a powerful tool that allows you to create dynamic documents, presentations, and websites from a single source file.

**Key Features:**
  
-   **Multi-language Support:** Use R, Python, Julia, and Observable JS in the same document.
-   **Literate Programming:** Combine narrative text with code to create reproducible reports.
-   **Multiple Outputs:** Generate high-quality output in various formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, e-books, and more.

## Why Quarto for Biostatisticians?

For biostatisticians, reproducibility and clear communication important. Quarto allows us to do both well.

-   **Reproducible Research:** Seamlessly integrate your R code, statistical analyses, and visualizations directly into your reports and presentations.
-   **Professional Outputs:** Create polished articles, presentations for conferences, and websites for your lab or personal portfolio.
-   **Collaboration:** Quarto projects are easy to share and collaborate on using version control systems like Git.
